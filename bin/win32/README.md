# Win32 API Generation

The traditional (C-style) APIs exposed by this library are generated from metadata. This folder contains code that loads
this metadata (primarily in the form of a JSON file) and generates a series of files representing FFI mappings and tests
as output.

## JSON Format
The format for the JSON file (`win32api.json`) is as follows:

```jsonc
{
    // API name (the generic name that will be presented in Dart code)
    "DeleteFile": {
        // The API prototype, as presented in Windows docs
        // Note that this should include a 'W' postfix if the declared function
        // has both Unicode and ANSI variants. See:
        // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/unicode-in-the-windows-api
        // 
        // The version presented in the docs is inconsistent -- some docs
        // include it, others don't -- so pay attention here. If you get a
        // failure in lookupFunction when running tests, this is a common
        // source of error.
        "prototype": "BOOL DeleteFileW(\n  LPCWSTR lpFileName\n);",

        // The DLL or API set that exports the API. For maximum compatibility,
        // API sets should only be used for APIs introduced in Windows 8 or
        // higher, and if used, the minimumWindowsVersion entry should be
        // specified to ensure that they aren't loaded on Windows 7. For more
        // information, see:
        // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/win32-and-com/win32-apis
        // and:
        // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/umbrella-lib-onecore
        "dllLibrary": "kernel32",
        // or
        "apiSet": "api-ms-win-core-file-l1-1-0",

        // (Optional) The category for documentation, if not the same as the
        // DLL library. 
        "category": "winrt",

        // The doc comment for the API (typically, first sentence of the docs)
        "comment": "Deletes an existing file.",

        // (Optional) Minimum version of Windows required to use this function. 
        // If omitted, this function will be available to all supported OSes.
        "minimumWindowsVersion": "WIN10_RS3",

        // (Optional) Whether a test should be generated for this function. 
        // Unless there's a *really* good mitigation for this, this should be
        // true.
        "test": false
    },
    ...
}
```

## Win32 API Notes

This section documents specific characteristics of certain APIs that may not be clear from the JSON file itself. It
should be used to call out exceptions that may not be intuitive.

### `TaskDialog*`

`TaskDialog` and `TaskDialogIndirect` is a special case since it requires `comctl32.dll` v6. This is not available to
`dart test` because of [Dart issue #42598](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/42598).

### `IsWow64Process2`
The Windows API documentation says `IsWow64Process2` is available in Windows Server 2016 (i.e. RS2 / build 10586), and
the header files mark it as available on any Windows 10 version. But the API itself is not available on such early
versions. This is noted in a [blog post by Rudy
Huyn](https://www.rudyhuyn.com/blog/2017/12/13/how-to-detect-that-your-x86-application-runs-on-windows-on-arm/) and through
inspection on a physical Windows Server 2016 machine.
